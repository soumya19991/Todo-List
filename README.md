# Todo-List
A front-end project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves building the visual and interactive elements of a website or web application that users engage with directly. Here's a brief description:

The HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the structure of the webpage, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and forms. It serves as the foundation, allowing you to organize content hierarchically and semantically.

The CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for styling the HTML content. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness, ensuring that the webpage looks visually appealing across different screen sizes and devices. CSS can transform a basic HTML page into a beautifully designed interface, with effects like transitions, animations, and hover states.

The JavaScript adds interactivity to the webpage, enabling dynamic features like form validation, dropdown menus, sliders, and pop-up modals. JavaScript can manipulate HTML and CSS on the fly, responding to user actions like clicks, input, or scrolling, creating a seamless user experience.
